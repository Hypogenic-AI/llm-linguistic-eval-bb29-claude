  title: Evaluating Linguistic Performance in LLMs
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models trained predominantly on English data may underperform
    when deployed in non-English-speaking countries. Evaluating LLM performance across
    multiple languages will reveal the extent of English-centric bias and whether
    these models possess implicit internal translation mechanisms.

    '
  background:
    description: Large language models are trained predominantly on English data,
      yet they are increasingly deployed at national scale in non-English-speaking
      countries (e.g., XAI partnership with Venezuela, OpenAI with Estonia). Despite
      this, model capability evaluations and training data are overwhelmingly English-centric.
      It may be interesting to host some evaluation benchmark or leaderboard for LLM
      performance across languages. Is it possible that these models have some implicit
      internal translation mechanisms?
